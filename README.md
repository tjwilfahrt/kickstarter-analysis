# Challenge Title: Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project & Purpose: Our client, Louise, is planning to launch a play called Fever. She requested an analysis of fund-raising campaigns in order to identify key characteristics of successful strategies. This analysis provides insight into the times of year and funding targets that will yield a successful campaign.

## Analysis: Months April through July prove to be the most favorable times of year to fund a Theater campaign (see Theater Outcomes vs. Launch Month chart). More so, campaigns run during May and June, are more likely to be twice as successful as Failed funderaisers. Data also notes a steady decline in success starting in May through the end of the year (See Theater Outcomes by Launch Month table). Overall, failed campaigns typically have higher goals than successful ones, and average pledge amounts are lower than successful campaigns.

## Digging deeper, data shows the quantity of Canceled campaigns is consistent across all twelve months, except for a gap from September to November where campaigns that may have been typically canceled might have been categorized as Failed. All things considered, Louise should target campaigns in May with funding targets of less than $1000 or, more appropriately, in the range of $3500 to $4500 (see Outcomes Based on Goal table).

## Challenges: My first challenge was grouping Row data in order to capture workable data groups. I experimented with Excel before using the “Hint” lifeline and Google-ing some additional information on how to effectively manage large sets of data. I also could not find a method to copy and paste COUNTIFS formulas across columns “Number Successful, Failed, and Canceled” and not having to manually adjust parameters in each cell.

## Results: 
- In general, there’s an inverse relationship between successful and failed theater campaigns. With that said, our client should target launching funding campaigns in May. There seems to be a correlation between canceled campaigns in months September through November and a spike in failed campaigns during those same months.

- Campaigns targeting less than $1000 and in the range of $3500 to $4500 are most successful. On the flip side, campaigns targeting ranges of $2500 to $3500 and $45000 to $50000 have the lowest success rate. Again, we can see an inverse relationship between successful and failed campaigns.

- Although this is an informative analysis, our data is limited in that we’re strictly analyzing Plays data. We may glean some additional insights by expanding our data scope to other types of performances.

-	It may be helpful to overlay campaign length data to better capture how time influences outcomes. We could also compare our data to that of other countries. Thirdly, we could certainly analyze longer-term ranges of data to determine if the fundraising cycle is yearly or if more years depict a more accurate analysis.
